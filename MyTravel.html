              <h2>Why Inyanga Mountains?</h2>
              <h3>Mount Inyangani, "the highest peak in the Zimbabwean lands"</h3>
              <p>
                The tallest peak in Zimbabwe, Mount Nyangani (originally Mount Inyangani), rises to a height of 2,592 metres, or 8,504 feet. About 110 kilometres (68 miles) northwest of Mutare, in the Nyanga District, lies the mountain, which is part of Nyanga National Park. Situated approximately 40 metres or 130 feet above the surrounding terrain, the summit is atop a small outcrop of granite. The remaining summit region is a vast moor covering roughly 8 km2 that is primarily made up of rolling hills and plateaus. Then, the east and west sides of this plateau's margins drop off sharply. With evergreen forest lining the wetter eastern slopes and grassland on the western side, the majority of the mountain vegetation is made up of heath surrounding the summit plateau. There is a lot of rainfall each year—roughly 2,200 mm.
            </p>
              <p>
                Afromontane vegetation, which includes a wide range of herbaceous plants, including some Afro-alpine species, is abundant in the mountains at high altitudes (1,800–2,400 m). It is primarily composed of fine-leaved dwarf shrubland. From the 1,650 m contour, which marks the edge of the montane forest, the IBA extends down to the eastern (windward) slopes, where atoontane rainforests can be found, and on the leeward slopes, in kloofs. This untouched forest is dominated by syzygium. Wet boulder-screeches and high valleys are home to Afrocrania montane forests. These woods are similar to those in Malawi and East Africa, which are located further north. Within fire-protected areas, there are isolated areas of drier Widdringtonia coniferous forest. Forests of dwarf Brachystegia are scattered throughout the grasslands in the drier, flatter west. In isolated areas at the base, acacia forests can be found.

                  <h4>SkyWalk</h4>
                  <p>
                    A first for both Zimbabwe and the rest of the world, the SkyWalk is genuinely unique. For the first time, a complete panoramic view of Mutarazi Falls and its surrounds is possible thanks to the two suspension bridges, which are shaped like vines growing above the falls. The two bridges that make up the SkyWalk are 30 metres long and span the edge of the Falls, while the other 90 metres spans the entire height of the Falls. This is for you if you have ever wanted to walk in midair. It takes about ten minutes to complete. The location of this activity is 12 kilometres from our home and is provided by Far and Wide.

                  <h4>Hiking Mt Inyanga</h4>
                  <p>
                    This enormous mountain rises to a height of 2592 metres. Trekking to the summit from any of the four base-entry locations will take one to three hours for an individual of average fitness. One thing that mountain bikers and hikers will find true about it is that it promises to be a difficult ascent. Heath covers the summit plateau of Mount Nyangani, with extensive grassland on the western side and evergreen forest on the wetter eastern slopes making up the mountain's vegetation.Mount Nyangani lies around 110 km to the northwest of Mutare. *Fun fact: the mountain gives rise to three rivers, two of which are tributaries of the Mazowe River, which empties into the vast Zambezi River.

                  <h4>Mutarazi Falls Skyline</h4>
                  <p>
                    The most exquisite zip line in the world is the SkyLine. The weather and day of the trip will determine whether you fly over Africa's second-highest waterfall via clear sky or through clouds. It's inspiring and thrilling to be flying at 50–70 km/h for 400 metres at an estimated 500 metres above the ground. With an eco-friendly and simplistic design, we hope the sensation lets you feel connected to the sky, waterfall, and surrounding natural environment when the wind rips through your hair and your heart races. Takes about fifteen minutes to complete.The location of this activity is 12 kilometres from our home and is provided by Far and Wide.
